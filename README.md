# Aleatoric Regression
A linear model which models both the mean and the variance. 

## Demo 
The Starter_Code.py is prepared to input a DataFrame with a Date Column and a Cycles Burned column. It log transforms the Cycles Burned in order to produce an exponential function. It outputs graphs of the model and prints the model parameters.
